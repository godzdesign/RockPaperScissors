# RockPaperScissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play in your web browser. 
I built it completely from scratch to improve my JavaScript skills. 
The idea for that game came after I was finished with my tic-tac-toe training. 
There is no great Design/UI I just wanted to make something work. 
Maybe I will add that later plus some other features like
- Animations
- Local Scoreboard
...
